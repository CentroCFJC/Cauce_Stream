"""In-memory WebSocket connection manager for the device channel.

One connection per registered device, identified by `device_uid`, carrying
the playback protocol (sync/command) and the power commands
(`power.command`). This is deliberately process-local state (no
Redis/external brokers for the MVP):

- Real-time notifications therefore require a SINGLE backend process
  (one uvicorn worker); connections are not shared between workers.
- PostgreSQL remains the source of truth: on reconnect, the `playback.sync`
  message is built from the persisted assignment, so the state is fully
  reconstructed after a restart or a lost notification.

All sends are isolated: a failing or abruptly-closed client never breaks
HTTP requests, heartbeats or other clients.
