"""Device management and heartbeat endpoints.

Queries require `devices.view`; registration and autoconfig require
`devices.manage`. The heartbeat is the public device-protocol endpoint:
it carries no user authentication (clients are devices, not users) and
can only update previously registered devices, never create them.
Unknown devices are accepted as pending discoveries only while the
autoconfig mode is enabled (they are still never auto-registered).

The WebSocket playback endpoint shares the device-protocol nature: no
user credentials (the same deferred device-security applies), only
registered devices, and it never replaces the heartbeat - liveness and
`current_media` still come exclusively from heartbeats.
