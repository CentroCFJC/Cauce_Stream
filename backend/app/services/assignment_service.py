"""Device-media assignment business logic.

The synchronization state is THE single comparison between the media the
administration assigned and the media the device reports playing
(`Device.current_media`): equal ids -> synchronized; anything else
(unknown, different id, never reported) -> pending. It says nothing
about successful playback: the current protocol only reports media
identifiers.
